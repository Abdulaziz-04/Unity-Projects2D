  storytext: 'Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly
    trash.

    

    You could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with
    one of the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some
    kind of leverage, maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.

    

    How
    to proceed?

    1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.

    2.
    Take the time to build a leverage-gadget.'
