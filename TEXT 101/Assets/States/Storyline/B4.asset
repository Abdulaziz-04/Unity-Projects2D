  storytext: "You tear off a piece of metal framing from your leather airship pilot
    armour and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts. As the door opens you rush at your
    captor, leaping like a crazy person and hollering a primal scream of rage.\r\n\r\nPayback
    time for your beating and from all the pain these dirty Festers have caused your
    family. You drive home your metal shiv. You hear the crunch of bones and feel
    the slice of flesh. \r\n\r\nAfter a brief struggle, there is stillness. You look
    down and see... oh my lord... you see... yourself? What? How?\r\n\r\n1. Continue..."
