  storytext: 'You take what feels like an eternity to scrounge a rock flinger and
    3 vials of tonix. When a huge machine cog lands an arm span from your head you
    decide its time to make your dash.

    

    You scramble aboard your airship.
    With all of your remaining strength, you lift the anchoring rope off its huge
    hook and give an all mighty shove.

    

    From behind you hear a surprised
    crew member. He rushes. You shoot. Direct hit. Thank goodness for the weapon.
    You''re safe. For now.
